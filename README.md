# ICS3U Final Project  – 2018

This project is a **culminating challenge** for applying knowledge and skills in an integrated and meaningful task. You will follow the software design life cycle to find the best solution to this challenge, demonstrating a mastery of the learning goals of our course.

## The Software Development Life Cycle

The phases of software development are:  Problem Definition, Analysis & Design, Writing Code, Testing & Documentation.

### Problem Definition

Choose a project that will meet all of the **learning goals** for the programming component of our course and matches your programming abilities.

This phase is composed of **two parts**:

1. Choose a **project idea** *(see examples below)*.
2. Describe the **specifications** of your project.  These are the details of how the project will function:  type of interface *(text/graphical)*, type of input *(keyboard/mouse)*, complexity – one or more levels, type of graphics, number of topics / questions, etc.  *What will your project look like when it is completed?*

### Analysis & Design

This will be an ongoing phase of your project.  On a **daily basis** you will make **‘journal entries’** that give evidence of your thought processes *(planning – input/output, how data will be stored, layout, algorithms, description of functions created, etc.)* on that day.

### Writing Code

You will create one or more files containing either **Python** or **Javascript/p5js** code that implements your design ideas.


### Testing and Documentation

You will provide **comments within your code** that describes what different blocks of code accomplish.  **Each function** you create should be accompanied by a **descriptive comment**.  You will provide a **User-guide** at the **end of your project** that describes what your project is, how to interact with it, and what bugs are still present / what still needs to be worked on.

**Testing**, along with documentation, will  be an ongoing phase of your project.  On a **daily basis** you will make **‘journal entries’** that give evidence of testing that you have done on that day.  It may involve testing a block of code or testing a function.  It is better to create functions for each block of code that performs some task, so that once it is working, it cannot be altered by other changes to the program.

## Choosing a Project

Your project should meet all the **learning goals** *(see moodle)* of the programming component of our course.  Here are some example projects that you might consider choosing.  If you have another idea, just get it approved by Mr. Guse.  

## Example projects:

### A Graphical Game

You could create a **simple card game**, a **memory game**, a **strategy game** like **reversi**, or an **animated game** like **brick breaker**.  You could also create something like a demonstration of the ***Stroop Effect***.

### A Text-based Game

You could create a quiz game like a ***Kahoot***, or ***Who Wants to be a Millionaire?***. It can be any form of game that you could imagine implementing with text-based interaction, including the graphical game ideas given above.


### A Jupyter Notebook

You could create a Jupyter notebook that uses programming ideas concepts to describe ideas you have learned in your **mathematics** or **science** courses.


**Note:**  You may find that your project requires you to **learn something new** that we haven’t covered in our class.  If that is the case, just ask Mr. Guse for assistance in getting this idea implemented.
